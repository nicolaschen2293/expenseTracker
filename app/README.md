# Expense Tracker App

A full-stack expense tracking application built with Supabase, React, and Node.js. This project uses Vercel for local development and deployment.

This project uses [`vercel dev`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/dev) to emulate both the frontend and serverless functions locally. To get started, you'll need a free Vercel account and to link the project to your own Vercel workspace.
